Use Github to fork and clone, or download, the repository https://github.com/phix/FSND_02.

You will end up with a new directory containing the VM files. Change to this directory in your terminal with `cd`. Inside, you will find another directory called **vagrant**. Change directory to the **vagrant** directory:

_Navigating to the FSND-Virtual-Machine directory and listing the files in it._
_This picture was taken on a Mac, but the commands will look the same on Git Bash on Windows._

From your terminal, inside the **vagrant** subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

_Starting the Ubuntu Linux installation with `vagrant up`._
_This screenshot shows just the beginning of many, many pages of output in a lot of colors._

When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!

_Logging into the Linux VM with `vagrant ssh`._

Inside the VM, change directory to `/vagrant` and look around with `ls`.

If you are now looking at a shell prompt that starts with the word `vagrant` (as in the above screenshot), congratulations â€” you've gotten logged into your Linux VM.
